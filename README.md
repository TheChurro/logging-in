# Logging In

An esoteric interface / game made for the University of Chicago class Embodied Data and Gamified Interfaces. In this, you will get insulted by a login screen and then have to navigate through google "trackers" to accurately access your data. In the end, you get kicked off to UChicago's official canvas site. If you are a student / teacher and already logged in, congrats!
